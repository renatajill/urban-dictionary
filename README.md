# URBAN DICTIONARY API
I'm using the API that showcases Urban dictionary definitions for a variety of terms. The definitions are given by users. I chose to use the information of definition, author and a permalink for every entry for the terms.

## HOW TO USE IT
1. To install the neccessary dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
2. To start the application:
```sh
npm start word
```
"word" is supposed to be the term you want to search on Urban Dictionary.

## THE RESULTS
The definitions will be shown on a text file called DefinitionsForword.txt in the root of the project.
